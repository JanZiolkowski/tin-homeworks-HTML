                One of the highest and most recognisable building in Warsaw can be seen from almost every part of
                the
                capital. Where did it come from? It was opened in 1955 on the initiative of Joseph Stalin as a “gift
                of
                the Soviet people for the Poles”.
                Built by Russian workers, for a long time, it was considered to be a symbol of socialist power and
                the
                pride
                of People’s Poland – it was where conventions of the Polish United Workers’ Party took place.
                Since its very beginning, its monumental interiors have hosted numerous concerts, exhibitions, fairs
                and
                shows.
                <blockquote class="wrapped-right">,,...a reminder of Soviet influence over the Poland."
                </blockquote>
                Go up to the observation deck on the 30th floor of the building and see the beautiful panorama of
                the
                city from a height of 114 metres.
                Take a look at the socialist realist sculptures placed in the niches of the palace’s facade. Each
                symbolises
                a different field of science, art, technology or culture, for example a young man with a book of
                classical literature,
                a member of komsomol, an archer and a woman from Central Asia. In a direct line from the main
                entrance,
                you
                will find a stone honour tribune, from which the first secretaries of the Central Committee of the
                Polish communist party greeted those marching on the May Day parade.
                In summer, the area around the palace becomes the arena for numerous concerts, theatre performances
                and
                film shows. In winter, it is a great place for skating enthusiasts thanks to the free ice skating
                rink.
                At night, the building is beautifully lit, and additional decorations illuminate special occasions.
                The building currently serves as an exhibition centre and office complex. The Palace contains a
                multiplex cinema with eight screens (Kinoteka), four theatres (Studio, Dramatyczny, Lalka and 6.
                piętro), two museums (Museum of Evolution and Museum of Technology), offices, bookshops, a large
                swimming pool, an auditorium hall for 3,000 people called Congress Hall, and an accredited
                university, Collegium Civitas, on the 11th and 12th floors of the building. The terrace on the 30th
                floor, at 114 metres (374 ft), is a well-known tourist attraction with a panoramic view of the city.

                A collection of sculptures representing figures of the fields of culture and science surrounds the
                Palace. Two of them are located in front of the main entrance: one of Polish astronomer Nicolaus
                Copernicus, by Ludwika Nitschowa, and another of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, by Stanisław
                Horno-Popławski.
                Four 6.3-metre (21 ft) clock faces were added to the top of the building ahead of the millennium
                celebrations in 2000. The clocks began working on 31 December 2000.

                The Warsaw Rising Museum was opened on the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of fighting in Warsaw.
                The Museum is a tribute of Warsaw’s residents to those who fought and died for independent Poland
                and
                its free capital.

                It covers all aspects of the Warsaw Uprising.
                There are exhibits over several floors, containing photographs, audio and video, interactive displays,
                artifacts, written accounts, and other testimonies of how life was during the German occupation of
                Warsaw,
                the
                uprising, and its aftermath. <img src="PW.png" alt="Polish Resistance Logo" class="wrapped-left">
                There are displays dedicated to each district of Warsaw. There are many free informative leaflets and
                flyers
                (in
                Polish and English), including 63 calendar pages covering the dates from 1 August 1944 to 2 October 1944
                –
                each
                containing a summary of the most important events that took place on that particular day of the
                uprising.
                The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide Operation Tempest, launched at the time of
                the Soviet Lublin–Brest Offensive. The main Polish objectives were to drive the Germans out of Warsaw
                while helping the Allies defeat Germany. An additional, political goal of the Polish Underground State
                was to liberate Poland's capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee
                of National Liberation could assume control. Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German
                round-ups of able-bodied Poles for "evacuation"; calls by Radio Moscow's Polish Service for uprising;
                and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German
                occupation.<blockquote class="wrapped-right">,,Warsaw calling all the free nations."</blockquote>
                Scholarship since the fall of the Soviet Union, combined with eyewitness accounts, has questioned Soviet
                motives and suggested their lack of support for the Warsaw Uprising represented their ambitions in
                Eastern Europe.

                Warsaw's Old Town Market Place (Polish: Rynek Starego Miasta) is the center and oldest part of the
                Old Town of Warsaw, Poland. Immediately after the Warsaw Uprising, it was systematically blown up by
                the German Army. After World War II, the Old Town Market Place was restored to its prewar
                appearance.The Old Town Market Place is the true heart of the Old Town, and until the end of the
                18th century it was the heart of all of Warsaw. It originated in the late 13th century, at the same
                time that the city was founded. Here the representatives of guilds and merchants met in the town
                hall (built before 1429, pulled down in 1817), and fairs and the occasional execution were held. The
                houses around it represented the Gothic style until the great fire of 1607, after which they were
                rebuilt in late-Renaissance style and eventually in late-Baroque style by Tylman Gamerski in
                1701.
                <img class="wrapped-right" src="old-market.jpeg" alt="Warsaw Old Market"></img>
                The main feature at that time was the immense town hall, reconstructed in 1580 in the style of
                Polish mannerism by Antoneo de Ralia and again between 1620 and 1621. The architecture of the
                building was similar to many other structures of that type in Poland (e.g. the town hall in
                Szydłowiec). It was adorned with attics and four side towers. A clock tower, embellished with an
                arcade loggia, was covered with a bulbous spire typical for Warsaw mannerist architecture (an
                example being the Royal Castle).

                The district was damaged by the bombs of the German Luftwaffe during the Invasion of Poland
                (1939). The ancient Market Place was rebuilt in the 1950s, after having been destroyed by the
                German Army after the suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. Today it is a major tourist
                attraction.

                Royal Baths Park the largest park in Warsaw, Poland, occupying 76 hectares of the city center. The
                park-and-palace
                complex lies in the Downtown district, on Ujazdów Avenue, which is part of the Royal Route linking the
                Royal Castle with Wilanów Palace to the south.

                In the mid-16th century, the Łazienki area became part of the estates of Queen Bona Sforza, who ordered
                the construction of a wooden manor house with an Italian garden. In 1624, King Sigismund III Vasa
                erected the four-sided stone Ujazdów Castle, north of the present Łazienki Park. Most of the Łazienki
                Park buildings were originally designed in the 17th century by Tylman van Gameren in the Baroque style
                for military commander Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski, including an ornate bathing pavilion that
                eventually gave its name to the gardens. In 1764, King Stanisław II August obtained Ujazdów and
                extensively remodeled the gardens. In 1918, following Poland's resumption of independence, Łazienki was
                officially designated a public park.

                The park's flora and fauna include over 9,500 trees and populations of peafowl and red squirrels. The
                Belweder, a historic palace and now one of the official residences of the President of Poland, borders
                the park's southern side. <blockquote class="wrapped-left">,,...designed by Tylman van Gameren."

                Łazienki Park was designed in the 17th century, in the baroque style, for military
                commander Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski. It took the name Łazienki ("Baths") from a bathing pavilion
                that was located nearby.

                The picturesque garden scheme owes its emergence as its present shape and appearance mainly to the last
                ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, King Stanisław August Poniatowski (Stanislaus II Augustus).
                In the mid-16th century, it became part of the estates of Poland's Italian-born Queen Bona Sforza, who
                built a wooden manor house with an Italian garden on this site. Later, the wooden manor house of Queen
                Anna Jagiellon stood on this spot, immortalized in 1578 by the performance of the first Polish play,
                Dismissal of the Greek Envoys by Jan Kochanowski. To the south, King Sigismund III Vasa had a four-sided
                stone castle with corner towers erected in 1624.

                POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews (Polish: Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich) is a museum on the
                site of the former Warsaw Ghetto. The Hebrew word Polin in the museum's English name means either
                "Poland" or "rest here" and relates to a legend about the arrival of the first Jews to Poland.
                Construction of the museum in designated land in Muranów, Warsaw's prewar Jewish quarter, began in 2009,
                following an international architectural competition won by Finnish architects Rainer Mahlamäki and
                Ilmari Lahdelma.
                <img src="museum-polish-jews.jpg" alt="museum of polish jews" class="wrapped-left">
                Completed at a cost of 320 million zł, the museum opened on 19 April 2013 with the core exhibition,
                showcasing the thousand-year history of Polish Jews, opening on 28 October 2014. The museum's
                architecture features a minimalist exterior with glass fins and copper mesh, and an interior designed by
                Event Communications. A central feature is the cavernous entrance hall, symbolizing the fractured
                history of Polish Jews. The organizational structure of POLIN includes an academic team led by Barbara
                Kirshenblatt-Gimblett and chief historian Antony Polonsky.

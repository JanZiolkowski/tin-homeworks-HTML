            One of the highest and most recognisable building in Warsaw can be seen from almost every part of the
            capital. Where did it come from? It was opened in 1955 on the initiative of Joseph Stalin as a “gift of the
            Soviet people for the Poles”.
            Built by Russian workers, for a long time, it was considered to be a symbol of socialist power and the pride
            of People’s Poland – it was where conventions of the Polish United Workers’ Party took place.
            Since its very beginning, its monumental interiors have hosted numerous concerts, exhibitions, fairs and
            shows.
            Currently, the palace is home to theatres, a cinema, museums, trendy pubs and the main Warsaw Tourist
            Information office.
            Go up to the observation deck on the 30th floor of the building and see the beautiful panorama of the city
            from a height of 114 metres.
            Take a look at the socialist realist sculptures placed in the niches of the palace’s facade. Each symbolises
            a different field of science, art, technology or culture, for example a young man with a book of classical
            literature,
            a member of komsomol, an archer and a woman from Central Asia. In a direct line from the main entrance, you
            will find a stone honour tribune, from which the first secretaries of the Central Committee of the Polish
            communist party greeted those marching on the May Day parade.
            In summer, the area around the palace becomes the arena for numerous concerts, theatre performances and film
            shows. In winter, it is a great place for skating enthusiasts thanks to the free ice skating rink. At night,
            the building is beautifully lit, and additional decorations illuminate special occasions.
